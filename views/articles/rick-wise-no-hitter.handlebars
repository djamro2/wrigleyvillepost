In my humble opinion, I would say that this is one of the top pitching performances in all of
baseball. On June 23rd, 1971, Rick Wise pitched a no-hitter against the Reds at Riverfront Stadium,
only giving up a walk in the 6th inning. As you could have probably guessed by the 
title, Wise would end up hitting two home runs in that same game, being the only pitcher
to do so to this day. This video shows the final out of that game.

There have been three other pitchers who have hit a home run as well as throwing a no-hitter.
They are: 
Wes Ferrel (1931), Earl Wilson (1962), and Jim Tobin (1944).

I thought I'd point this event in baseball history because a player like this tends to be pretty rare
nowadays. Most pitchers put all their eggs in one basket (which probably make sense statistically),
though people who can play the whole game don't come around as often. Now I should
probably watch my words as this could lead to some nasty DH arguments.
Anyways, here's a cool <a href="http://amzn.to/1Goc2pq">card of his</a> that I found on Amazon:
